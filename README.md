# parser
This is unfinished test task. 
The main idea of the task: 
- the app receives any string data in any format (i.e csv, json), 
- then it must sort and filter this data with some requirements, that we receive from console input params
- finaly the app outputs to the console sorted, filtered and formatted data, i.e. json or xml 

The main requirements:
- the app must be flexible with extension to any other input formats - json, REST Api and so on
- the app must be flexible with extension to any other output formats - xml, pdf, word and so on
- input data must be validated

Current stage of the app is sketch ))
